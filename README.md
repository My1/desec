# desec
doc and php examples of desec

Simply said the desec docs are a little bit chaotic and the API in my opinion a bit unnessecarily complex.

the use of httpie commands for documentation purposes instead of the plain HTTP requests also further complicated things as it apparently implies things that other methods like cURL dont.
